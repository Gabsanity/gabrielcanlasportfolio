          <h3>My Story</h3>
          <p>
            I've graduated Bachelor of Science in Information Technology at
            Centro Escolar University Malolos. I wanted to become a front-end
            web devoloper someday. I'm currently self studying the fundamentals
            of HTML5, CSS3 and JAVASCRIPT.
          </p>
          <p>
            I hope someday I can be a front end developer because it is dream my
            job. I like minimal designs and creating things simple but
            beautiful. I'm currently practicing for a month now and I'm planning
            to contiue untill I can make my own website.

          <h3>My Practices</h3>
          <p>
            Here are my work, I'm still practicing, I made a couple of websites
            like a so-called portfolio, there is a video gallery webpage because I
            also love to make a short film. I am also the CMS coordinator in our school and in our sister school (Pampanga Institute)
            I'm the one who is maintaining our school websites and making sure that they are
            always updated.
          </p>
          <p>
            My latest creation was the kuya travel and tours. It is almost
            perfect for me as a beginner because it is responsive, but also the
            buttons are working. As a begginner that is a good creation for me.
            I've choose the color of the website according to its logo.
