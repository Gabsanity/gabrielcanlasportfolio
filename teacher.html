          <h3>My Story</h3>
          <p>
            I've graduated Bachelor of Science in Information Technology at
            Centro Escolar University Malolos. I wanted to become a front-end
            web devoloper someday. I'm currently self studying the fundamentals
            of HTML5, CSS3 and JAVASCRIPT.
          </p>
          <p>
            I hope someday I can be a front end developer because it is dream
            job. I like minimal designs and creating things simple but
            beautiful. I'm currently practicing for a month now and I'm planning
            to contiue untill I can make my own website.

          <h3>My Work</h3>
          <p>
            I've started being a teacher way back 2017. I've started as an ICT
            teacher in Pampanga Colleges. I also earned my units in teaching in
            this school. I love to share my knowledge about technology in my
            students and I want to build their skills that they can use in
            future.
          </p>
          <p>
            Now, I'm a grade 12 adviser teacher of ICT Gemini. I'm also the
            sports coordinator and basketball coach of our basketball team. I'm
            a competetive and dicipline person. I'm implementing a strict
            dicipline and training to our basketball team. I'm pushing them to
            their limits to surpass their expectations.
