          <h3>My Story</h3>
          <p>
            I've graduated Bachelor of Science in Information Technology at
            Centro Escolar University Malolos. I wanted to become a front-end
            web devoloper someday. I'm currently self studying the fundamentals
            of HTML5, CSS3 and JAVASCRIPT.
          
          </p>
          I hope someday I can be a front end developer because it is dream my
            job. I like minimal designs and creating things simple but
            beautiful. I'm currently practicing for a month now and I'm planning
            to contiue untill I can make my own website.

          <h3>My Work</h3>
          <p>
            I have also knowledge in video and photo editing
            I love editing some pictures, making logos and creating a short film
            I can do a lot of things using adobe photoshop, adobe illustrator
            adobe after effects, and adobe premiere
          </p>
          <p>
            I know I can use my skills and knowledge in your company
            I'm just a beginner but I am more than willing to learn more because 
            it is my passion. I am not after the salary that you will offer as long
            as I am gaining some experience and knowling a lot of things that is enough
            for me.
